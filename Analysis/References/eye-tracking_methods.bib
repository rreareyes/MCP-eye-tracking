	title = {Towards a theory of heuristic and optimal planning for sequential information search},
	url = {https://osf.io/bxdf4},
	abstract = {How should tests (or queries, questions, or experiments) be selected? Does it matter if only a single test is allowed, or if a sequential test strategy can be planned in advance? This article contributes two sets of theoretical results bearing on these questions. First, for selecting a single test, several Optimal Experimental Design (OED) ideas have been proposed in statistics and other disciplines. The OED models are mathematically nontrivial. How is it that they often predict human behavior well? One possibility is that simple heuristics can approximate or exactly implement OED models. We prove that heuristics can identify the highest information value queries (as quantified by OED models) in several situations, thus providing a possible algorithmic-level theory of human behavior. Second, we address whether OED models are optimal for sequential search, as is frequently presumed. We consider the Person Game, a 20-questions scenario, as well as a two-category, binary feature scenario, both of which have been widely used in psychological research. In each task, we demonstrate via specific examples and extended computational simulations that neither the OED models nor the heuristics considered in the literature are optimal. Little research addresses human behavior in such situations. We call for experimental research into how people approach the sequential planning of tests, and theoretical research on what sequential planning procedures are most successful, and we offer a number of testable predictions for discriminating among candidate models.},

As such, remote eye-trackers are marketed as allowing the reliable recording of gaze from participant groups that cannot be restrained, such as infants, schoolchildren and patients with muscular or brain disorders. Practical experience and previous research, however, tells us that eye-tracking data quality, e.g. the accuracy of the recorded gaze position and the amount of data loss, deteriorates (compared to well-trained participants in chinrests) when the participant is unrestrained and assumes a non-optimal pose in front of the eye-tracker. How then can researchers working with unrestrained participants choose an eye-tracker? Here we investigated the performance of five popular remote eyetrackers from EyeTribe, SMI, SR Research, and Tobii in a series of tasks where participants took on non-optimal poses.},

Four decision theories are examined: rational models, bounded rationality, evidence accumulation, and parallel constraint satisfaction models. Although most theories were conﬁrmed with regard to certain predictions, none of the theories adequately accounted for the role of attention during decision making. Several observations emerged concerning the drivers and down-stream effects of attention on choice, suggesting that attention processes plays an active role in constructing decisions. So far, decision theories have largely ignored the constructive role of attention by assuming that it is entirely determined by heuristics, or that it consists of stochastic information sampling. The empirical observations reveal that these assumptions are implausible, and that more accurate assumptions could have been made based on prior attention and eye movement research. Future decision making research would beneﬁt from greater integration with attention research.},

Apart from just relying on task accuracies and completion times, eye movements can additionally be recorded to later study visual task solution strategies and the cognitive workload of study participants. During an eye tracking experiment many data sets are recorded. Standard techniques to analyze this eye tracking data are heat map and scan path visualizations. However, it still requires a high effort to analyze scan path trajectory data to ﬁnd common task solution strategies among the study participants. In this chapter we discuss three existing methodologies for analyzing the vast amount of eye tracking data from a visualization and visual analytics perspective. These three approaches are a classical static visualization, visual analytics techniques and ﬁnally a software prototype, which helps the user to manage, view and analyze the recorded data in a simple interactive way.},

	abstract = {We asked participants to make simple risky choices while we recorded their eye movements. We built a complete statistical model of the eye movements and found very little systematic variation in eye movements over the time course of a choice or across the different choices. The only exceptions were ﬁnding more (of the same) eye movements when choice options were similar, and an emerging gaze bias in which people looked more at the gamble they ultimately chose. These ﬁndings are inconsistent with prospect theory, the priority heuristic, or decision ﬁeld theory. However, the eye movements made during a choice have a large relationship with the ﬁnal choice, and this is mostly independent from the contribution of the actual attribute values in the choice options. That is, eye movements tell us not just about the processing of attribute values but also are independently associated with choice. The pattern is simple—people choose the gamble they look at more often, independently of the actual numbers they see—and this pattern is simpler than predicted by decision ﬁeld theory, decision by sampling, and the parallel constraint satisfaction model. © 2015 The Authors.

Crucially, we show systematic contextual and individual differences in the use of Pwin heuristic.

The researcher can test hypotheses by examining the impact of independent variables and their interactions on these components. A worked example using MLR is provided.},

	abstract = {While the close link between eye movements and visual attention has often been demonstrated, recently distinct attentional modes have been associated with speciﬁc eye movement patterns. The ambient mode—serving the localization of objects and dominating early scene inspection—is expressed by short ﬁxations and large saccade amplitudes. The focal mode—associated with the identiﬁcation of object details and dominating later stages of scene exploration—is indicated by longer ﬁxations embedded in short saccades. The relationship between these processing modes and eye movement characteristics has so far only been examined in adults. While studies in children revealed a maturation of oculomotor behavior up to adolescence, developmental aspects of the processing modes are still unknown. Here we explored these mechanisms by comparing eye movements during the inspection of naturalistic scenes. Therefore, gaze behavior from adults and children in four different age groups (2, 4–6, 6–8, 8–10 years old) was examined. We found a general effect of age, revealing that with age ﬁxation durations decrease and saccade amplitudes increase. However, in all age groups ﬁxations were shorter and saccades were longer at the beginning of scene inspection but ﬁxations became longer and saccades became shorter over time. While saliency inﬂuenced eye guidance in the two youngest groups over the full inspection period, for the older groups this inﬂuence was found only at the beginning of scene inspection. The results reveal indications for ambient and focal processing strategies for as early as 2 years of age.},
