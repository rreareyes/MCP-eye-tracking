	abstract = {Although models of exploratory decision making implicate a suite of strategies that guide the pursuit of information, the developmental emergence of these strategies remains poorly understood. This study takes an interdisciplinary perspective, merging computational decision making and developmental approaches to characterize age-related shifts in exploratory strategy from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants were 149 12–28-year-olds who completed a computational explore– exploit paradigm that manipulated reward value, information value, and decision horizon (i.e., the utility that information holds for future choices). Strategic directed exploration, defined as information seeking selective for long time horizons, emerged during adolescence and maintained its level through early adulthood. This age difference was partially driven by adolescents valuing immediate reward over new information. Strategic random exploration, defined as stochastic choice behavior selective for long time horizons, was invoked at comparable levels over the age range, and predicted individual differences in attitudes toward risk taking in daily life within the adolescent portion of the sample. Collectively, these findings reveal an expansion of the diversity of strategic exploration over development, implicate distinct mechanisms for directed and random exploratory strategies, and suggest novel mechanisms for adolescent-typical shifts in decision making.},

	abstract = {How should tests (or queries, questions, or experiments) be selected? Does it matter if only a single test is allowed, or if a sequential test strategy can be planned in advance? This article contributes two sets of theoretical results bearing on these questions. First, for selecting a single test, several Optimal Experimental Design (OED) ideas have been proposed in statistics and other disciplines. The OED models are mathematically nontrivial. How is it that they often predict human behavior well? One possibility is that simple heuristics can approximate or exactly implement OED models. We prove that heuristics can identify the highest information value queries (as quantified by OED models) in several situations, thus providing a possible algorithmic-level theory of human behavior. Second, we address whether OED models are optimal for sequential search, as is frequently presumed. We consider the Person Game, a 20-questions scenario, as well as a two-category, binary feature scenario, both of which have been widely used in psychological research. In each task, we demonstrate via specific examples and extended computational simulations that neither the OED models nor the heuristics considered in the literature are optimal. Little research addresses human behavior in such situations. We call for experimental research into how people approach the sequential planning of tests, and theoretical research on what sequential planning procedures are most successful, and we offer a number of testable predictions for discriminating among candidate models.},

As such, remote eye-trackers are marketed as allowing the reliable recording of gaze from participant groups that cannot be restrained, such as infants, schoolchildren and patients with muscular or brain disorders. Practical experience and previous research, however, tells us that eye-tracking data quality, e.g. the accuracy of the recorded gaze position and the amount of data loss, deteriorates (compared to well-trained participants in chinrests) when the participant is unrestrained and assumes a non-optimal pose in front of the eye-tracker. How then can researchers working with unrestrained participants choose an eye-tracker? Here we investigated the performance of five popular remote eyetrackers from EyeTribe, SMI, SR Research, and Tobii in a series of tasks where participants took on non-optimal poses.},

Four decision theories are examined: rational models, bounded rationality, evidence accumulation, and parallel constraint satisfaction models. Although most theories were conﬁrmed with regard to certain predictions, none of the theories adequately accounted for the role of attention during decision making. Several observations emerged concerning the drivers and down-stream effects of attention on choice, suggesting that attention processes plays an active role in constructing decisions. So far, decision theories have largely ignored the constructive role of attention by assuming that it is entirely determined by heuristics, or that it consists of stochastic information sampling. The empirical observations reveal that these assumptions are implausible, and that more accurate assumptions could have been made based on prior attention and eye movement research. Future decision making research would beneﬁt from greater integration with attention research.},

Apart from just relying on task accuracies and completion times, eye movements can additionally be recorded to later study visual task solution strategies and the cognitive workload of study participants. During an eye tracking experiment many data sets are recorded. Standard techniques to analyze this eye tracking data are heat map and scan path visualizations. However, it still requires a high effort to analyze scan path trajectory data to ﬁnd common task solution strategies among the study participants. In this chapter we discuss three existing methodologies for analyzing the vast amount of eye tracking data from a visualization and visual analytics perspective. These three approaches are a classical static visualization, visual analytics techniques and ﬁnally a software prototype, which helps the user to manage, view and analyze the recorded data in a simple interactive way.},

We built a complete statistical model of the eye movements and found very little systematic variation in eye movements over the time course of a choice or across the different choices. The only exceptions were ﬁnding more (of the same) eye movements when choice options were similar, and an emerging gaze bias in which people looked more at the gamble they ultimately chose. These ﬁndings are inconsistent with prospect theory, the priority heuristic, or decision ﬁeld theory. However, the eye movements made during a choice have a large relationship with the ﬁnal choice, and this is mostly independent from the contribution of the actual attribute values in the choice options. That is, eye movements tell us not just about the processing of attribute values but also are independently associated with choice. The pattern is simple—people choose the gamble they look at more often, independently of the actual numbers they see—and this pattern is simpler than predicted by decision ﬁeld theory, decision by sampling, and the parallel constraint satisfaction model. © 2015 The Authors.

	abstract = {While the close link between eye movements and visual attention has often been demonstrated, recently distinct attentional modes have been associated with speciﬁc eye movement patterns. The ambient mode—serving the localization of objects and dominating early scene inspection—is expressed by short ﬁxations and large saccade amplitudes. The focal mode—associated with the identiﬁcation of object details and dominating later stages of scene exploration—is indicated by longer ﬁxations embedded in short saccades. The relationship between these processing modes and eye movement characteristics has so far only been examined in adults. While studies in children revealed a maturation of oculomotor behavior up to adolescence, developmental aspects of the processing modes are still unknown. Here we explored these mechanisms by comparing eye movements during the inspection of naturalistic scenes. Therefore, gaze behavior from adults and children in four different age groups (2, 4–6, 6–8, 8–10 years old) was examined. We found a general effect of age, revealing that with age ﬁxation durations decrease and saccade amplitudes increase. However, in all age groups ﬁxations were shorter and saccades were longer at the beginning of scene inspection but ﬁxations became longer and saccades became shorter over time. While saliency inﬂuenced eye guidance in the two youngest groups over the full inspection period, for the older groups this inﬂuence was found only at the beginning of scene inspection. The results reveal indications for ambient and focal processing strategies for as early as 2 years of age.},

Alternatively, conﬁdence is framed in mathematics as an objective statistical quantity: the probability that a chosen hypothesis is correct. Despite similar terminology, it remains unclear whether the subjective feeling of conﬁdence is related to the objective, statistical computation of conﬁdence. To address this, we collected conﬁdence reports from humans performing perceptual and knowledge-based psychometric decision tasks. We observed two counterintuitive patterns relating conﬁdence to choice and evidence: apparent overconﬁdence in choices based on uninformative evidence, and decreasing conﬁdence with increasing evidence strength for erroneous choices. We show that these patterns lawfully arise from statistical conﬁdence, and therefore occur even for perfectly calibrated conﬁdence measures. Furthermore, statistical conﬁdence quantitatively accounted for human conﬁdence in our tasks without necessitating heuristic operations. Accordingly, we suggest that the human feeling of conﬁdence originates from a mental computation of statistical conﬁdence.},

We investigate the computational complexity of ﬁnding optimal cue permutations for lexicographic strategies and prove that the problem is NP-complete. It follows that no efﬁcient (that is, polynomial-time) algorithm computes optimal solutions, unless P = NP. We further analyze the complexity of approximating optimal cue permutations for lexicographic strategies.

As a complement to work within this paradigm, we investigate the problem of selecting an optimal combination of prediction methods from a given toolbox of such local methods, in the context of changing environments. These selection methods are called meta-inductive (MI) strategies, if they are based on the success-records of the toolbox-methods. No absolutely optimal MI strategy exists—a fact that we call the ‘‘revenge of ecological rationality’’. Nevertheless one can show that a certain MI strategy exists, called ‘‘AW’’, which is universally long-run optimal, with provably small short-run losses, in comparison to any set of prediction methods that it can use as input. We call this property universal access-optimality. Local and short-run improvements over AW are possible, but only at the cost of forfeiting universal access-optimality. The last part of the paper includes an empirical study of MI strategies in application to an 8-year-long data set from the Monash University Footy Tipping Competition.},

The rationality of human cognition is often evaluated in terms of normative standards based on a priori intuitions. Yet this approach has been challenged by two recent developments in psychology that we review in this article: ecological rationality and descriptivism. Going beyond these contributions, we consider it a good moment for psychologists and philosophers to join forces and work toward a new foundation for the deﬁnition of rational cognition. We take a ﬁrst step in this direction by proposing that the rationality of both cognitive and normative systems can be measured in terms of their cognitive success. Cognitive success can be deﬁned and gauged in terms of two factors: ecological validity (the system’s validity in conditions in which it is applicable) and the system’s applicability (the scope of conditions under which it can be applied). As we show, prominent systems of reasoning —deductive reasoning, Bayesian reasoning, uncertain conditionals, and prediction and choice—perform rather differently on these two factors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that conceptualizing rationality according to its cognitive success offers a new perspective on the time-honored relationship between the descriptive (“is”) and the normative (“ought”) in psychology and philosophy.},

It is subserved by plasticity in many neural systems, including neocortical regions (sensory, prefrontal, parietal, and motor cortex), the medial temporal lobe, the basal ganglia, and midbrain dopaminergic systems. These systems interact during category learning. Corticostriatal loops may mediate recursive, bootstrapping interactions between fast reward-gated plasticity in the basal ganglia and slow reward-shaded plasticity in the cortex. This can provide a balance between acquisition of details of experiences and generalization across them. Interactions between the corticostriatal loops can integrate perceptual, response, and feedback-related aspects of the task and mediate the shift from novice to skilled performance. The basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe interact competitively or cooperatively, depending on the demands of the learning task.},

Speciﬁcally, they showed that risky options with high-value outcomes are inferred to have lower probability than options oﬀering a less valuable reward. We report two experiments that test a simple corollary of this idea. In both studies, participants estimated the magnitude of prizes oﬀered by lotteries with known win-probabilities. The relationship between estimates and probabilities followed the power relationship predicted by the risk-reward heuristic, albeit with a tendency to overestimate outcome magnitude. In addition, people’s estimates predicted their willingness to take the gamble. Our results provide further evidence that people have internalized the ecological relationship between risk and reward in ﬁnancial lotteries, and we suggest that this relationship exerts a wide-ranging inﬂuence on decision-making.},

Efficient coding leads to ‘robust’ decisions that depart from optimality but maximise the information transmitted by a limited-capacity system in a rapidly-changing world.

	abstract = {Simple lexicographic decision heuristics that consider cues one at a time in a particular order and stop searching for cues as soon as a decision can be made have been shown to be both accurate and frugal in their use of information. But much of the simplicity and success of these heuristics comes from using an appropriate cue order. For instance, the Take The Best heuristic uses validity order for cues, which requires considerable computation, potentially undermining the computational advantages of the simple decision mechanism. But many cue orders can achieve good decision performance, and studies of sequential search for data records have proposed a number of simple ordering rules that may be of use in constructing appropriate decision cue orders as well. Here we consider a range of simple cue ordering mechanisms, including tallying, swapping, and move-to-front rules, and show that they can find cue orders that lead to reasonable accuracy and considerable frugality when used with lexicographic decision heuristics.},

One advantage of computational models is that they provide access to latent variables that cannot be directly observed from behavior. In combination with experimental manipulations, these latent variables can help to test hypotheses about age-related changes in behavioral and neurobiological measures at a level of speciﬁcity that is not achievable with descriptive analysis approaches alone. This level of speciﬁcity can in turn be beneﬁcial to establish the identity of the corresponding behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms. In this paper, we will illustrate applications of computational methods using examples of lifespan research on risk taking, strategy selection and reinforcement learning. We will elaborate on problems that can occur when computational neuroscience methods are applied to data of diﬀerent age groups. Finally, we will discuss potential targets for future applications and outline general shortcomings of computational neuroscience methods for research on human lifespan development.},

How do decision makers determine in what sequence to collect information and when to stop? In two experiments, we administered a version of the German cities task developed by Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996), in which participants had to decide which of two cities had the larger population. Decision makers were not provided with the names of the cities, but they were able to collect different kinds of cues for both response alternatives (e.g., “Does this city have a university?”) before making a decision. Our experiments differed in whether participants were free to determine the number of cues they examined. We demonstrate that a novel model, using hierarchical latent mixtures and Bayesian inference (Lee \& Newell, 2011) provides a more complete description of the data from both experiments than simple conventional strategies, such as the take–the–best or the Weighted Additive heuristics.},

	abstract = {Maximizing long-run gains often requires taking on some degree of risk, yet decisionmakers often exhibit risk aversion (RA), rejecting risky prospects even when these have higher expected value (EV) than safer alternatives. We investigated whether explicit strategy instruction and practice can decrease prepotent RA, and whether aging impacts the efﬁcacy of such an intervention. Participants performed a paired lottery task with options varying in risk and magnitude, both before and after practice with a similar task that encouraged maximization of EV and instruction to use this strategy in risky decisions. In both younger and older adults (OAs), strategy training reduced RA. Although RA was age-equivalent at baseline, larger training effects were observed in younger adults (YAs). These effects were not explained by risk-related (i.e., affective) interference effects or computation ability, but were consistent with a progressive, age-related neglect of the strategy across trials. Our ﬁndings suggest that strategy training can diminish RA, but that training efﬁcacy is reduced among OAs, potentially due to goal neglect. We discuss implications for neural mechanisms that may distinguish older and YAs’ risky decision-making.},

	abstract = {In multi-attribute choice, decision makers use decision strategies to arrive at the ﬁnal choice. What are the neural mechanisms underlying decision strategy selection? The ﬁrst goal of this paper is to provide a literature review on the neural underpinnings and cognitive models of decision strategy selection and thus set the stage for a neurocognitive model of this process. The second goal is to outline such a unifying, mechanistic model that can explain the impact of noncognitive factors (e.g., affect, stress) on strategy selection. To this end, we review the evidence for the factors inﬂuencing strategy selection, the neural basis of strategy use and the cognitive models of this process. We also present the Bottom-Up Model of Strategy Selection (BUMSS). The model assumes that the use of the rational Weighted Additive strategy and the boundedly rational heuristic Take The Best can be explained by one unifying, neurophysiologically plausible mechanism, based on the interaction of the frontoparietal network, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus. According to BUMSS, there are three processes that form the bottom-up mechanism of decision strategy selection and lead to the ﬁnal choice: (1) cue weight computation, (2) gain modulation, and (3) weighted additive evaluation of alternatives. We discuss how these processes might be implemented in the brain, and how this knowledge allows us to formulate novel predictions linking strategy use and neural signals.},

	abstract = {We incorporated behavioral and computational modeling techniques to examine age-based differences in strategy use in two four-choice decision-making tasks. Healthy older (aged 60–82 years) and younger adults (aged 18–23 years) performed one of two decision-making tasks that differed in the degree to which rewards for each option depended on the choices made on previous trials. In the choice-independent task rewards for each choice were not affected by the sequence of previous choices that had been made. In contrast, in the choicedependent task rewards for each option were based on how often each option had been chosen in the past. We compared the ﬁts of a model that assumes the use of a win-stay–lose-shift (WSLS) heuristic to make decisions, to the ﬁts of a reinforcement-learning (RL) model that compared expected reward values for each option to make decisions. Younger adults were best ﬁt by the RL model, while older adults showed signiﬁcantly more evidence of being best ﬁt by the WSLS heuristic model. This led older adults to perform worse than younger adults in the choice-independent task, but better in the choice-dependent task. These results coincide with previous work in our labs that also found better performance for older adults in choice-dependent tasks (Worthy et al., 2011), and the present results suggest that qualitative age-based differences in the strategies used in choice tasks may underlie older adults’ advantage in choice-dependent tasks. We discuss possible factors behind these differences such as neurobiological changes associated with aging, and increased use of heuristics by older adults.},

	abstract = {In decision under risk, participants act as if their choices were based on probability values systematically different from those that are objectively correct. Similar systematic distortion is found in tasks involving relative frequency judgments and confidence ratings. Observed distortions are highly patterned. They are also dynamic: the same participant can have different distortions in different tasks. We propose a model of probability distortion as a form of bounded rationality. This Bounded Log-Odds Model (BLO) is based on the plausible assumptions that (1) the neural representation of probability has a fixed, limited dynamic range (“the bound”) and that (2) that objective probability is dynamically remapped to its internal representation to compensate for the limitations imposed by the bound (“rationality”). We test the further hypothesis that (3) the choice of mapping in any task serves to maximize the mutual information between objective probabilities in a task and their distorted neural representation. We test these claims in four experiments, two involving judgment of relative frequency, one concerning decision under risk, and a fourth involving both. The last experiment allows us to compare probability distortion in two different kinds of task in a single participant. We demonstrate that BLO accounts for human performance in all of these experiments. We are even able to predict individual choices of probability distortion function across tasks and conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that, subject to these BLO constraints, people optimize their information transmission or nearly so, a form of rational behavior constrained by immutable bounds.},

	abstract = {The fast-and-frugal heuristic framework assumes noncompensatory tools for human preferences (i.e., priority heuristic) and inferences (i.e., take the best heuristic). According to this framework, these heuristics predict choice behavior as well as model the cognitive processes underlying such behavior. The current paper presents two studies that juxtapose predictions derived from these two simple heuristics with alternative predictions derived from compensatory principles. Dependent measures that included reaction time, choice pattern, conﬁdence level, and accuracy were better predicted by compensatory indices than by noncompensatory indices. These ﬁndings suggest that people do not rely on limited arguments only, but tend to integrate all acquired information into their choice processes. This tendency was replicated even when the experimental task facilitated the use of noncompensatory principles. We argue that the fast and frugal heuristics can predict the ﬁnal outcome only under certain conditions, but even in these particular situations they are not applicable to the processes underlying choice behavior. An integrative model for choice behavior is proposed that better represents the data. Copyright \# 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The generalized models make allowances for subjective attribute weighting, probabilistic orders of attribute inspection, and noisy decision making. A key new test involves a response-time (RT) approach. TTB predicts that RT is determined solely by the expected time required to locate the 1st discriminating attribute, whereas RAT predicts that RT is determined by the difference in summed evidence between the 2 alternatives. Critical test pairs are used that partially decouple these 2 factors. Under conditions in which ideal observer TTB and RAT strategies yield equivalent decisions, both the RT results and the estimated attribute weights suggest that the vast majority of subjects adopted the generalized TTB strategy. The RT approach is also validated in an experimental condition in which use of a RAT strategy is essentially forced upon subjects.},

When examining choices, however, elementary school children (unlike preschoolers) systematically used probabilities as weights in their decisions.

Because heuristics do not require all available information, they are thought to be easy to implement and to not tax limited cognitive resources, which has led heuristics to be characterized as fast-and-frugal. We question this monolithic conception of heuristics by contrasting the cognitive demands of two popular heuristics, Tallying and Take-the-Best. We contend that heuristics that are frugal in terms of information usage may not always be fast because of the attentional control required to implement this focus in certain contexts. In support of this hypothesis, we find that Take-the-Best, while being more frugal in terms of information usage, is slower to implement and fares worse under time pressure manipulations than Tallying. This effect is then reversed when search costs for Take-the-Best are reduced by changing the format of the stimuli. These findings suggest that heuristics are heterogeneous and should be unpacked according to their cognitive demands to determine the circumstances a heuristic best applies.},

Ethical uncertainty arises if the agent cannot assign precise utilities to consequences. Option uncertainty arises when the agent does not know what precise consequence an act has at every state. Finally, state space uncertainty exists when the agent is unsure how to construct an exhaustive state space. These types of uncertainty are characterised along three dimensions - nature, object and severity - and the relationship between them is examined. We conclude that these di↵erent forms of uncertainty cannot be reduced to empirical uncertainty about the state of the world without inducing an increase in its severity.},

Although there has been considerable progress due to methodical traditions like ‘Structural Modeling’ and ‘Process Tracing’, these paradigms have certain limitations in testing speciﬁc hypotheses about individual strategies. Some of these problems are summarized brieﬂy. A deductive method for classifying individual response patterns is introduced. Predictions about regression coefﬁcients are deduced from competing substantial hypotheses about strategies for decision making. These can be tested at the level of individual participants. The validity of this classiﬁcation procedure is demonstrated with a Monte Carlo simulation.

Contrary to common assertions about the impact of cognitive complexity, the empirical data suggest that manipulated variables exert their inﬂuence at the meta-level of deciding how to decide (i.e., which strategy to select) rather than at the level of strategy execution.

In tasks with cue information presented in on-screen displays, rule-based strategies tend to dominate unless the abstraction of cue-target relations is unfeasible. This dominance has also been demonstrated — surprisingly — in experiments that demanded the retrieval of cue values from memory (M. Persson \& J. Rieskamp, 2009). In three modiﬁed replications involving a ﬁctitious disease, binary cue values were represented either by alternative symptoms (e.g., fever vs. hypothermia) or by symptom presence vs. absence (e.g., fever vs. no fever). The former representation might hinder cue abstraction. The cues were predictive of the severity of the disease, and participants had to infer in each trial who of two patients was sicker. Both experiments replicated the rule-dominance with present-absent cues but yielded higher percentages of exemplar-based strategies with alternative cues. The experiments demonstrate that a change in cue representation may induce a dramatic shift from rule-based to exemplar-based reasoning in formally identical tasks.},

In the 1970s and 1980s, researchers assumed that people rely on a two-stage magnitude comparison process to make these decisions (Banks, 1977; Moyer \& Dumais, 1978). More recently, the focus has shifted to approaches that rely on probabilistic cues and simple heuristics (Gigerenzer \& Goldstein, Psychological Review 103, 650–669, 1996). Here, we test competing predictions derived from these two very different approaches and conclude that the magnitude comparison process plays a central role in this task. In support of this conclusion, we present an experiment in which participants were timed as they decided which of two vehicles was more expensive. Pairs composed of one luxury vehicle (e. g., BMW 323i) and one nonluxury vehicle (e.g., Toyota 4Runner) were critical because the magnitude comparison approach correctly predicted that reaction times would decrease with subjective distance, whereas the heuristics approach incorrectly predicted that there would be no relation.},

	abstract = {According to the recognition heuristic (RH), for decision domains where recognition is a valid predictor of a choice criterion, recognition alone is used to make inferences whenever one object is recognized and the other is not, irrespective of further knowledge. Erdfelder, Küpper-Tetzel, and Mattern (2011) questioned whether the recognition judgment itself aﬀects decisions or rather the memory strength underlying it. Speciﬁcally, they proposed to extend the RH to the memory state heuristic (MSH), which assumes a third memory state of uncertainty in addition to recognition certainty and rejection certainty. While the MSH already gathered signiﬁcant support, one of its basic and more counterintuitive predictions has not been tested so far: In guessing pairs (none of the objects recognized), the object more slowly judged as unrecognized should be preferred, since it is more likely to be in a higher memory state. In this paper, we test this prediction along with other recognition latency predictions of the MSH, thereby adding to the body of research supporting the MSH.},

Models that account for context effects typically assume a within-dimension comparison process; however, the presentation format of a choice set can influence comparison strategies. The present study jointly tests the influence of presentation format on the attraction, compromise, and similarity effects in a within-subjects design. Participants completed a series of choices designed to elicit each of the three context effects, with either a by-alternative or by-dimension format. Whereas the by-alternative format elicited a standard similarity effect, but null attraction and reverse compromise effects, the by-dimension format elicited standard attraction and compromise effects, but a reverse similarity effect. These novel results are supported by a re-analysis of the eye-tracking data collected by Noguchi and Stewart (Cognition, 132(1), 44–56, 2014) and demonstrate that flexibility in the comparison process should be incorporated into theories of preferential choice.},

Although H\&B are often studied in isolation from others, emerging research has suggested that stable and reliable individual diﬀerences in rational thought exist, and similarity in performance across tasks are related, which may suggest an underlying phenotypic structure of decision-making skills. Though numerous theoretical and empirical classiﬁcations have been oﬀered, results have been mixed. The current study aimed to clarify this research question. Participants (N = 289) completed a battery of 17 H\&B tasks, assessed with a within-subjects design, that we selected based on a review of prior empirical and theoretical taxonomies. Exploratory and conﬁrmatory analyses yielded a solution that suggested that these biases conform to a model composed of three dimensions: Mindware gaps, Valuation biases (i.e., Positive Illusions and Negativity eﬀect), and Anchoring and Adjustment. We discuss these ﬁndings in relation to proposed taxonomies and existing studies on individual diﬀerences in decision-making.},

Despite this, the nature of belief, which underpins the construct of delusions, has received little formal investigation. No account of delusions, however, would be complete without a cognitive level analysis of belief per se. One reason for this neglect is the assumption that, unlike more established and accessible modular psychological process (e.g., vision, audition, face-recognition, language-processing, and motor-control systems), beliefs comprise more distributed and therefore less accessible central cognitive processes. In this paper, we suggest some deﬁning characteristics and functions of beliefs. Working back from cognitive accounts of delusions, we consider potential candidate cognitive processes that may be involved in normal belief formation. Finally, we advance a multistage account of the belief process that could provide the basis for a more comprehensive model of belief.},

	abstract = {Decision science is an area of enquiry that crosses many disciplines, from psychology to economics, each with their own perspective of decision-making. Traditionally, mathematicians have envisaged decision-making as a purely rational endeavor, whereas psychologists and behavioral economists have critiqued this narrative and suggested that cognitive short cuts are the real mechanisms behind how decisions are made. However, contemporary dual process theorists argue that two systems of the mind exist: system 1 (intuitive decision-making) and system 2 (rational decision-making). The current review will present a relatively new metaphor for decision-making: the unified threshold model. This model is a global approach to decision-making which allows both intuitive and rational decision-making processes to be explained in a more flexible manner than the dual process model. This review will introduce the reader to different types of threshold models (counter and diffusion), their assumptions, and their ability to explain decision-making behavior. Implications and future research will also be discussed. In summary, the aim of this review is to highlight that a rather than the unified threshold model of decisionmaking may give a more adequate explanation of decision-making data in comparison to previous models and theories.},

In this article, the authors evaluate the psychological plausibility of the assumptions upon which PMM were built and, consequently, the psychological plausibility of several of the fast and frugal heuristics. The authors argue that many of PMM theory’s assumptions are questionable, given available data, and that fast and frugal heuristics are, in fact, psychologically implausible.},

But how does the brain learn to associate conﬁgurations with outcomes and how does this learning differ from learning about individual elements? We combined behavior, reinforcement learning models, and functional imaging to understand how people learn to associate conﬁgurations of cues with outcomes. We found that conﬁgural learning depended on the relative predictive strength of elements versus conﬁgurations and was related to both the strength of BOLD activity and patterns of BOLD activity in the hippocampus. Conﬁgural learning was further related to functional connectivity between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Moreover, conﬁgural learning was associated with ﬂexible knowledge about associations and differential eye movements during choice. Together, this suggests that conﬁgural learning is associated with a distinct computational, cognitive, and neural proﬁle that is well suited to support ﬂexible and adaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {People seldom enjoy access to summarized information about risky options before making a decision. Instead, they may search for information and learn about environmental contingencies—thus making decisions from experience. Aging is associated with notable deﬁcits in learning and memory—but do these translate into poorer decisions from experience? We report three studies that used a sampling paradigm to investigate younger (M = 24 years) and older (M = 71 years) adults’ decisions from experience. In Study 1 (N = 121) participants made 12 decisions between pairs of payoff distributions in the lab. Study 2 (N = 70) implemented the same paradigm using portable devices, collecting 84 decisions per individual over a week. Study 3 (N = 84) extended the sampling paradigm by asking participants to make 12 decisions between two, four, and eight payoff distributions (in the lab). Overall, the behavioral results suggest that younger and older adults are relatively similar in how they search and what they choose when facing two payoff distributions (Studies 1 and 2). With an increasing number of payoff distributions, however, age differences emerged (Study 3). A modeling analysis on the level of individual participants showed that a simple delta-learning rule model best described the learning processes of most participants. To the extent that ongoing updating processes unfold relatively automatically and effortlessly, older adults may be liberated from the detrimental consequences of cognitive aging in the case of decisions from experience with few decision options. We discuss implications for research on decisions from experience and choice performance over the lifespan.},

The idea that cue validities cannot be computed because memory does not encode missing information is misinformed; it implies that measures of co-occurrence are incomputable and would invalidate most theories of cue learning. They also questioned the recognition heuristic’s psychological plausibility on the basis of their belief that it has not been implemented in a memory model, although it actually has been implemented in ACT-R (L. J. Schooler \& R. Hertwig, 2005). On the positive side, M. R. Dougherty et al. discovered a new mechanism for a less-is-more effect. The authors of the present article specify minimal criteria for psychological plausibility, describe some genuine challenges in the study of heuristics, and conclude that fast and frugal heuristics are psychologically plausible: They use limited search and are tractable and robust.},

	abstract = {As reﬂected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efﬁcient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do “rational” decisions as deﬁned by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (“Which heuristics do people use in which situations?”) and the prescriptive question (“When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?”), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

We then show that heuristics can lead to judgments that are as accurate as or even more accurate than strategies that use more information and computation, including optimization methods. A standard way to defend the use of heuristics is by reference to accuracy-effort trade-offs. We take a different route, emphasizing ecological rationality (the relationship between cognitive heuristics and environment), and argue that in uncertain environments, more information and computation are not always better (the “less-can-be-more” doctrine). The resulting naturalism about rationality is thus normative because it not only describes what heuristics people use, but also in which speciﬁc environments one should rely on a heuristic in order to make better inferences.

In its portrayal, people have systematic cognitive biases that are not only as persistent as visual illusions but also costly in real life—meaning that governmental paternalism is called upon to steer people with the help of “nudges.” These biases have since attained the status of truisms. In contrast, I show that such a view of human nature is tainted by a “bias bias,” the tendency to spot biases even when there are none. This may occur by failing to notice when small sample statistics diﬀer from large sample statistics, mistaking people’s random error for systematic error, or confusing intelligent inferences with logical errors. Unknown to most economists, much of psychological research reveals a diﬀerent portrayal, where people appear to have largely ﬁne-tuned intuitions about chance, frequency, and framing. A systematic review of the literature shows little evidence that the alleged biases are potentially costly in terms of less health, wealth, or happiness. Getting rid of the bias bias is a precondition for psychology to play a positive role in economics.},

Savage (The foundations of statistics, Wiley, New York, 1954) limited axiomatic rationality to small worlds (S, C), that is, situations in which the exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of future states S and their consequences C are known. Others have interpreted axiomatic rationality as a categorical norm for how human beings should reason, arguing in addition that violations would lead to real costs such as money pumps. Yet a review of the literature shows little evidence that violations are actually associated with any measurable costs. Limiting axiomatic rationality to small worlds, I propose a naturalized version of rationality for situations of intractability and uncertainty (as opposed to risk), all of which are not in (S, C). In these situations, humans can achieve their goals by relying on heuristics that may violate axiomatic rationality. The study of ecological rationality requires formal models of heuristics and an analysis of the structures of environments these can exploit. It lays the foundation of a moderate naturalism in epistemology, providing statements about heuristics we should use in a given situation. Unlike axiomatic rationality, ecological rationality can explain less-ismore effects (when using less information can be expected to generate more accurate predictions), formalize when one should move from ‘is’ to ‘ought,’ and be evaluated by goals beyond coherence, such as predictive accuracy, frugality, and efﬁciency. Ecological rationality can be seen as a formalization of means–end instrumentalist rationality, based on Herbert Simon’s insight that rational behavior is a function of the mind and its environment.},

In the 1st experiment, information was openly presented, whereas in the 2nd experiment, the standard Mouselab program was used under different time limits. The results indicate that individuals are able to compute weighted additive decision strategies extremely quickly if information search is not restricted by the experimental procedure. In a 3rd experiment, these results were replicated using more complex decision tasks, and the major alternative explanations that individuals use more complex heuristics or that they merely encode the constellation of cues were ruled out. In sum, the findings challenge the fundaments of bounded rationality and highlight the importance of automatic processes in decision making.},

The parallel-constraint-satisfaction model, in contrast, predicts that information is processed in a reciprocal fashion. Specifically, it assumes that subjective cue validities interactively affect each other and are modified to coherently support the favored choice. Corresponding to the model’s simulation, we predicted the direction of such coherence shifts.Cue validities were measured before, after (Exp. 1) and during judgment (Exp. 2 \& 3). Coherence shifts were found in environments involving real-world cue knowledge (weather forecasts) and in a domain for which the application of fast-and-frugal heuristics has been demonstrated (citysize tasks).

To achieve sufﬁciently sensitive tests, we rely on a multiple-measure methodology including choice, reaction time, and conﬁdence data as well as eye-tracking. Results show that manipulating the environmental structure produces clear adaptive shifts in choice patterns – as both frameworks would predict.

Plenty of evidence exists that people can employ different judgment strategies to solve identical judgment problems. In categorization, it has been demonstrated that similarity-based and rule-based strategies are associated with activity in different brain regions. Building on this research, the present work tests whether solving two identical judgment problems recruits different neural substrates depending on people’s judgment strategies. Combining cognitive modeling of judgment strategies at the behavioral level with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we compare brain activity when using two archetypal judgment strategies: a similarity-based exemplar strategy and a rule-based heuristic strategy. Using an exemplar-based strategy should recruit areas involved in long-term memory processes to a larger extent than a heuristic strategy. In contrast, using a heuristic strategy should recruit areas involved in the application of rules to a larger extent than an exemplar-based strategy. Largely consistent with our hypotheses, we found that using an exemplar-based strategy led to relatively higher BOLD activity in the anterior prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, presumably related to retrieval and selective attention processes. In contrast, using a heuristic strategy led to relatively higher activity in areas in the dorsolateral prefrontal and the temporal-parietal cortex associated with cognitive control and information integration. Thus, even when people solve identical judgment problems, different neural substrates can be recruited depending on the judgment strategy involved.},

	abstract = {In everyday life, people encounter smaller rewards with higher probability than larger rewards. Do people expect this reward–probability regularity to hold in experimental settings? To answer this question, we tested whether people’s behavior in probability judgment tasks is affected by the correlation between reward size and reward probabilities. In Study 1, we asked people to judge reward probabilities under uncertainty. In line with the ecological reward–probability correlation, people assumed that larger rewards were less likely than smaller rewards. In Study 2, we tested the prediction that people’s information search and integration depend on the representativeness of the environment. Participants performed an experience-based probability judgment task in which they sampled outcomes from unknown gambles until they felt confident to estimate the probabilities of the gambles’ outcomes. We manipulated the reward–probability relationship of the gambles in 3 experimental groups. Rewards and reward probabilities were negatively correlated, positively correlated, or not correlated at all. A negative correlation mimics the ecological reward–probability relationship often present in real life. We analyzed people’s search effort and whether they integrated sample-based uncertainty into their judgments. We found that people sampled fewer outcomes in the ecologically representative condition than in the other 2 conditions. However, people did not integrate sample-based uncertainty in their judgments: In all conditions people treated the observed outcomes as representative of the underlying outcome distribution. People’s prior beliefs about regularities in environments provides a potential explanation of why people often rely on small sample sizes when making judgments and decisions from experience.},

	abstract = {Judgments about objects in the world are often based on probabilistic information (or cues). A frugal judgment strategy that utilizes memory (i.e., the ability to discriminate between known and unknown objects) as a cue for inference is the recognition heuristic (RH). The usefulness of the RH depends on the structure of the environment, particularly the predictive power (validity) of recognition. Little is known about developmental differences in use of the RH. In this study, the authors examined (a) to what extent children and adolescents recruit the RH when making judgments, and (b) around what age adaptive use of the RH emerges. Primary schoolchildren (M ϭ 9 years), younger adolescents (M ϭ 12 years), and older adolescents (M ϭ 17 years) made comparative judgments in task environments with either high or low recognition validity. Reliance on the RH was measured with a hierarchical multinomial model. Results indicated that primary schoolchildren already made systematic use of the RH. However, only older adolescents adaptively adjusted their strategy use between environments and were better able to discriminate between situations in which the RH led to correct versus incorrect inferences. These findings suggest that the use of simple heuristics does not progress unidirectionally across development but strongly depends on the task environment, in line with the perspective of ecological rationality. Moreover, adaptive heuristic inference seems to require experience and a developed base of domain knowledge.},

In two studies, we analyzed the effects of decision mode instructions on processes of information search and integration, using eye-tracking technology in a between-participants (Study 1) and a within-participants (Study 2) design. Our ﬁndings indicate that the instruction to deliberate does not necessarily lead to qualitatively different information processing compared to the instruction to decide intuitively. We found no difference in mean ﬁxation duration and the distribution of short, medium and long ﬁxations. Short ﬁxations in particular prevailed under both decision mode instructions, while long ﬁxations indicating a conscious and calculation-based information processing were rarely observed. Instruction-induced deliberation led to a higher number of ﬁxations, a more complete information search and more repeated information inspections. We interpret our ﬁndings as support for the hypothesis that intuitive and deliberate decision modes share the same basic processes which are supplemented by additional operations in the deliberate decision mode.},

	abstract = {The Centre for Adaptive Behaviour and Cognition (ABC) has hypothesised that much human decision-making can be described by simple algorithmic process models (heuristics). This paper explains this approach and relates it to research in biology on rules of thumb, which we also review. As an example of a simple heuristic, consider the lexicographic strategy of Take The Best for choosing between two alternatives: cues are searched in turn until one discriminates, then search stops and all other cues are ignored. Heuristics consist of building blocks, and building blocks exploit evolved or learned abilities such as recognition memory; it is the complexity of these abilities that allows the heuristics to be simple. Simple heuristics have an advantage in making decisions fast and with little information, and in avoiding overﬁtting. Furthermore, humans are observed to use simple heuristics. Simulations show that the statistical structures of different environments affect which heuristics perform better, a relationship referred to as ecological rationality. We contrast ecological rationality with the stronger claim of adaptation. Rules of thumb from biology provide clearer examples of adaptation because animals can be studied in the environments in which they evolved. The range of examples is also much more diverse. To investigate them, biologists have sometimes used similar simulation techniques to ABC, but many examples depend on empirically driven approaches. ABC’s theoretical framework can be useful in connecting some of these examples, particularly the scattered literature on how information from different cues is integrated. Optimality modelling is usually used to explain less detailed aspects of behaviour but might more often be redirected to investigate rules of thumb.},

Specifically, we assessed to which extent heuristics, models implementing weighted additive information integration (WADD), and the parallel constraint satisfaction (PCS) network model approximate the Bayesian solution and how often they lead to correct decisions in a probabilistic decision task. PCS and WADD outperform simple heuristics on both criteria with an approximation of 88.8 \% and a performance of 73.7 \%.

We show that one common methodological choice prevailing in parts of this work makes it hard to draw sound conclusions concerning the central questions of how often people indeed use simpliﬁed strategies (e.g., fast-and-frugal heuristics) and whether they select between them adaptively. Conclusions from this work are biased insofar that more complex weighted compensatory strategies, such as Franklin's Rule, that are considered alternatives to fastand-frugal heuristics are speciﬁed in a way that leads to a systematic underestimation of the degree to which they are relied on. Speciﬁcally, the common practice of not correcting cue validities for chance level results in a substantial disadvantage for weighted compensatory strategies. Model recovery simulations and a reanalysis of published data correspondingly show overestimation of the reliance on fast-and-frugal heuristics for various environments used in prominent studies. Furthermore, our results indicate that the magnitude of this overestimation is contingent on the structure of the environment so that strategy selection is mimicked without any material basis. As a result, even completely rational individuals would be erroneously classiﬁed as adaptive users of simple strategies. We recommend that chance corrected implementations of weighted compensatory strategies should be included in all future studies investigating the usage of adaptive strategies and argue that comprehensive re-analyses of previous work are warranted.

Lateral orbitofrontal cortex supported contingent learning and reﬂected contingencies between outcomes and their causal choices. Amygdala responses around reward times related to statistical patterns of learning. Time-based heuristic mechanisms were related to activity in sensorimotor corticostriatal circuitry.

The goal of this paper is to investigate whether such behavior is appropriate for multi-attribute binary choice. We model the experimentally observed ‘‘thirst for conﬁrming redundancy’’ (Bruner, Goodnow, \& Austin, 1956) through a simple heuristic strategy (CONF) that needs two consistent cues to make a binary choice. Analytical expressions for the probabilities that CONF chooses correctly between two alternatives and takes a decision after considering fewer than all pieces of evidence are presented. Importantly, CONF is advantageously insensitive to cue ordering. The model performs equally well in both structured environments, where cues are ordered by validity, and unstructured environments, where the cues are not consulted in the order of their validity. We further compare the performance of CONF with the performance of other heuristics in a series of simulated three-cue environments, where the cues are continuous and vary in both predictive ability and inter-correlation. We show that across environments, CONF balances the advantages and disadvantages of other simple models. We conclude that conﬁrmation-seeking in multi-attribute decision making is a simple, fast, and robust ‘‘ignorance’’ strategy that hedges your bets when you know that you might not know.},

Earlier studies have classified strategies as highllow proportion of available information used, constantlvariable amount of search across alternatives, and intra-linterdimensional direction of search. However, more powerful analyses are needed, since the search characteristics of a given strategy may be variable and highly taskdependent. Two major means of improving search analysis are discussed: (a) the use of task-specific simulations to establish the search characteristics expected from different strategies; and (b) the analysis of additional search characteristics, such as the extent to which future information search is controlled by prior information (contingency), and different types of search variability. An experimental example of the use of these techniques is presented. Applications are proposed in three areas: (a) the study of sequential combinations of decision rules, and multi-phase decision making; (b) exploration of the possibility that there exists continuous variation among strategies along various parameters, rather than a set of discrete rules; and (c) the investigation of how decision makers adapt strategy t o task.},

Seven suggestions are offered to assist the FFH and H\&B communities in improving intuitive decision making and in conducting research that has greater potential for application. Rather than trying to help people analyze which option to choose, the NDM community recommends that intuitions be strengthened by providing a broader experience base that lets people build better tacit knowledge, such as perceptual skills and richer mental models, as a means of achieving better decisions. © 2015 Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition.

	abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of uncertainty, scientific attention has focused primarily on probabilistic approaches, which predominantly rely on the assumption that uncertainty can be measured and expressed numerically. At the same time, the increasing amount of research from a range of areas including psychology, economics, and sociology testify that in the real world, people’s understanding of risky and uncertain situations cannot be satisfactorily explained in probabilistic and decision-theoretical terms. In this article, we offer a theoretical overview of an alternative approach to uncertainty developed in the framework of the ecological rationality research program. We first trace the origins of the ecological approach to uncertainty in Simon’s bounded rationality and Brunswik’s lens model framework and then proceed by outlining a theoretical view of uncertainty that ensues from the ecological rationality approach. We argue that the ecological concept of uncertainty relies on a systemic view of uncertainty that features it as a property of the organism–environment system. We also show how simple heuristics can deal with unmeasurable uncertainty and in what cases ignoring probabilities emerges as a proper response to uncertainty.},

	abstract = {A popular distinction in cognitive and social psychology has been between intuitive and deliberate judgments. This juxtaposition has aligned in dual-process theories of reasoning associative, unconscious, effortless, heuristic, and suboptimal processes (assumed to foster intuitive judgments) versus rule-based, conscious, effortful, analytic, and rational processes (assumed to characterize deliberate judgments). In contrast, we provide convergent arguments and evidence for a unified theoretical approach to both intuitive and deliberative judgments. Both are rule-based, and in fact, the very same rules can underlie both intuitive and deliberate judgments. The important open question is that of rule selection, and we propose a 2-step process in which the task itself and the individual’s memory constrain the set of applicable rules, whereas the individual’s processing potential and the (perceived) ecological rationality of the rule for the task guide the final selection from that set. Deliberate judgments are not generally more accurate than intuitive judgments; in both cases, accuracy depends on the match between rule and environment: the rules’ ecological rationality. Heuristics that are less effortful and in which parts of the information are ignored can be more accurate than cognitive strategies that have more information and computation. The proposed framework adumbrates a unified approach that specifies the critical dimensions on which judgmental situations may vary and the environmental conditions under which rules can be expected to be successful.},

We tested whether this basic Bayesian framework could explain human subjects’ behavior in two estimation tasks in which we varied the strength of sensory evidence (motion coherence or contrast) and priors (set of directions or orientations). We found that despite excellent agreement of estimates mean and variability with a Basic Bayesian observer model, the estimate distributions were bimodal with unpredicted modes near the prior and the likelihood. We developed a model that switched between prior and sensory evidence rather than integrating the two, which better explained the data than the Basic and several other Bayesian observers. Our data suggest that humans can approximate Bayesian optimality with a switching heuristic that forgoes multiplicative combination of priors and likelihoods.},

The ﬁrst is that they incorporate multiple sources of behavior, using the predictions that strategies make about processes and outcomes as a basis for inferring strategy use. The second is that they allow for people to change strategies multiple times over a sequence of decision trials. The models are implemented as generative probabilistic models, allowing for fully Bayesian inference about the nature of strategy use and the number of strategy switches. To demonstrate the approach and evaluate the models, we consider the standard take-the-best, weighted-additive, and tally strategies, as well as a guessing strategy, and apply them to previously published experimental data that involve decision, search, and verbal report data (Walsh \& Gluck, 2016). We ﬁnd strong evidence that many people switch strategies many times, especially when inference is based on all of the available behavioral data. Our results suggest there is interpretable complexity beneath people’s use of simple strategies to make decisions.},

Recently, research on decisions from experience has made progress in ﬁnding out how individual characteristics shape search for information. Surprisingly little is known, however, about how the properties of the choice ecology shape people’s search. To ﬁll this void, we analyzed how two key ecological properties inﬂuence search effort: domain of choice (gains vs. losses) and experienced variance (variance vs. no variance). Many people search longer when facing the prospect of losses relative to gains. Moreover, most people search more in options in which they experience variance relative to options they experience as invariant. We conclude that two factors that have been identiﬁed as important determinants of choice also inﬂuence search of information.},

We leverage rational metareasoning to derive a rational solution to this problem and apply it to decision making under uncertainty. The resulting theory reconciles the two poles of the debate about human rationality by proposing that people gradually learn to make rational use of fallible heuristics. We evaluate this theory against empirical data and existing accounts of strategy selection (i.e. SSL and RELACS). Our results suggest that while SSL and RELACS can explain people’s ability to adapt to homogeneous environments in which all decision problems are of the same type, rational metareasoning can additionally explain people’s ability to adapt to heterogeneous environments and ﬂexibly switch strategies from one decision to the next.},

Using a series of simple mathematical tasks, we assessed participants’ responses against two criteria of rationality: transitivity and accuracy. In Study 1, the relation between the number of transitivity violations and the number of errors was best described by a reversed U-shaped function. This means that, as long as the participants use an adequate strategy and computational errors are merely accidental, transitivity violation positively relates to the number of errors. Otherwise, if the participants use an inadequate strategy that leads to systematic errors, transitivity violation negatively relates to the number of errors. We replicated these findings in Study 2. People can make decisions that comply with the transitivity criterion but are inaccurate; being erroneous, though transitive, does not make one’s behavior rational.},

Older adults tended to (a) look up less information and take longer to process it and (b) use simpler, less cognitively demanding strategies. In accordance with the idea that age-related cognitive decline leads to reliance on simpler strategies, measures of fluid intelligence explained age-related differences in information search and strategy selection.

	abstract = {The notion of ecological rationality sees human rationality as the result of the adaptive ﬁt between the human mind and the environment. Ecological rationality focuses the study of decision making on two key questions: First, what are the environmental regularities to which people’s decision strategies are matched, and how frequently do these regularities occur in natural environments? Second, how well can people adapt their use of speciﬁc strategies to particular environmental regularities? Research on aging suggests a number of changes in cognitive function, for instance, deﬁcits in learning and memory that may impact decision-making skills. However, it has been shown that simple strategies can work well in many natural environments, which suggests that age-related deﬁcits in strategy use may not necessarily translate into reduced decision quality. Consequently, we argue that predictions about the impact of aging on decision performance depend not only on how aging affects decision-relevant capacities but also on the decision environment in which decisions are made. In sum, we propose that the concept of the ecological rationality is crucial to understanding and aiding the aging decision maker.},

In turn, ecological approaches to life span development suggest that successful performance can result from an adaptive employment of an individual’s physical, cognitive, or social capital in the appropriate environment. This ecological framework suggests that one must understand the demands of particular ecologies (i.e., niches) to predict whether aging is associated with failure, maintenance, or even improvements in performance. We provide examples that illustrate the importance of an ecological approach to understanding adaptation to challenging decision tasks both in the laboratory and in the wild. Overall, we propose that there are specific strategies and niches that can help older adults thrive and that more work is needed to understand the exact characteristics that lead to good performance in old age.},

Uncertainty is generally reduced to a form of risk, quantiﬁable in some probabilistic format. We challenge both conceptualizations and connect heuristics and uncertainty in a functional way: When uncertainty does not lend itself to risk calculations, heuristics can fare better than complex, optimization-based strategies if they satisfy the criteria for being ecological rational. This insight emerges from merging Knightian uncertainty with the study of fast-and-frugal heuristics. For many decision theorists, uncertainty is an undesirable characteristic of a situation, yet in the world of business it is considered a necessary condition for proﬁt. In this article, we argue for complementing the study of decision making under risk using probability theory with a systematic study of decision making under uncertainty using formal models of heuristics. In doing so, we can better understand decision making in the real world and why and when simple heuristics are successful.},

While many core facets of executive function may reach maturation in childhood, these processes continue to be refined and stabilized during adolescence. We propose that this is mediated, in part, by interactions between the hippocampus and pre-frontal cortex. Specifically, we propose that development of this circuit refines adolescents’ ability to extract relevant information from prior experience to support task-relevant behavior. In support of this model, we review evidence for protracted structural and functional development both within and across the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We describe emerging research demonstrating the refinement of adolescents’ ability to integrate prior experiences to support goal-oriented behavior, which parallel hippocampal-prefrontal integration. Finally, we speculate that the development of this circuit is mediated by increases in dopaminergic neuromodulation present in adolescence, which may underlie memory processing, plasticity, and circuit integration. This model provides a novel characterization of how memory and executive systems integrate throughout adolescence to support adaptive behavior.},

Our experiments show that though there is a high degree of individual variability, success is a key determinant of search.

In contrast, the principal metaphor of cognitive psychology conceptualizes humans as ‘information processors’, employing processes of perception, memory, categorization, problem solving and so on. Many of the processes described in cognitive theories are similar to those involved in decision making, and thus increasing cross-fertilization between the two areas is an important endeavour. A wide range of models and metaphors has been proposed to explain and describe ‘information processing’ and many models have been applied to decision making in ingenious ways. This special issue encourages cross-fertilization between cognitive psychology and decision research by providing an overview of current perspectives in one area that continues to highlight the beneﬁts of the synergistic approach: cognitive modeling of multi-attribute decision making. In this introduction we discuss aspects of the cognitive system that need to be considered when modeling multi-attribute decision making (e.g., automatic versus controlled processing, learning and memory constraints, metacognition) and illustrate how such aspects are incorporated into the approaches proposed by contributors to the special issue. We end by discussing the challenges posed by the contrasting and sometimes incompatible assumptions of the models and metaphors.},

	abstract = {To function effectively, brains need to make predictions about their environment based on past experience, i.e., they need to learn about their environment. The algorithms by which learning occurs are of interest to neuroscientists, both in their own right (because they exist in the brain) and as a tool to model participants’ incomplete knowledge of task parameters and hence, to better understand their behavior. This review focusses on a particular challenge for learning algorithms—how to match the rate at which they learn to the rate of change in the environment, so that they use as much observed data as possible whilst disregarding irrelevant, old observations. To do this algorithms must evaluate whether the environment is changing. We discuss the concepts of likelihood, priors and transition functions, and how these relate to change detection. We review expected and estimation uncertainty, and how these relate to change detection and learning rate. Finally, we consider the neural correlates of uncertainty and learning. We argue that the neural correlates of uncertainty bear a resemblance to neural systems that are active when agents actively explore their environments, suggesting that the mechanisms by which the rate of learning is set may be subject to top down control (in circumstances when agents actively seek new information) as well as bottom up control (by observations that imply change in the environment).},

It is thought that humans overcome these limitations through satisficing, fast but “good-enough” heuristic decision making that prioritizes some sources of information (cues) while ignoring others. However, the decision-making strategies we adopt under uncertainty and time pressure, for example during emergencies that demand split-second choices, are presently unknown. To characterize these decision strategies quantitatively, the present study examined how people solve a novel multicue probabilistic classification task under varying time pressure, by tracking shifts in decision strategies using variational Bayesian inference. We found that under low time pressure, participants correctly weighted and integrated all available cues to arrive at near-optimal decisions. With increasingly demanding, subsecond time pressures, however, participants systematically discounted a subset of the cue information by dropping the least informative cue(s) from their decision making process. Thus, the human cognitive apparatus copes with uncertainty and severe time pressure by adopting a “drop-the-worst” cue decision making strategy that minimizes cognitive time and effort investment while preserving the consideration of the most diagnostic cue information, thus maintaining “good-enough” accuracy. This advance in our understanding of satisficing strategies could form the basis of predicting human choices in high time pressure scenarios.},

To mitigate these pressures, people “satisﬁce”, foregoing a full evaluation of all available evidence to focus on a subset of cues that allow for fast and “good-enough” decisions. Although this form of decision-making likely mediates many of our everyday choices, very little is known about the way in which the neural encoding of cue information changes when we satisﬁce under time pressure. Here, we combined human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a probabilistic classiﬁcation task to characterize neural substrates of multi-cue decision-making under low (1500 ms) and high (500 ms) time pressure. Using variational Bayesian inference, we analyzed participants’ choices to track and quantify cue usage under each experimental condition, which was then applied to model the fMRI data. Under low time pressure, participants performed nearoptimally, appropriately integrating all available cues to guide choices. Both cortical (prefrontal and parietal cortex) and subcortical (hippocampal and striatal) regions encoded individual cue weights, and activity linearly tracked trial-by-trial variations in the amount of evidence and decision uncertainty. Under increased time pressure, participants adaptively shifted to using a satisﬁcing strategy by discounting the least informative cue in their decision process. This strategic change in decision-making was associated with an increased involvement of the dopaminergic midbrain, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum in representing and integrating cue values. We conclude that satisﬁcing the probabilistic inference process under time pressure leads to a cortical-to-subcortical shift in the neural drivers of decisions.},

Although precise tests have clear merits, I critically evaluate the value of such tests as they are currently employed. First, I argue that using precise measures of the exclusive use of recognition has to go beyond showing that the recognition heuristic—like every model—cannot capture reality completely. Second, I illustrate how precise tests based on response times can lead to unsubstantiated conclusions if the fact that the recognition heuristic does not model the recognition judgment itself is ignored. Finally, I highlight two key but so far neglected aspects of the recognition heuristic: (a) the connection between recognition memory and the recognition heuristic; and (b) the mechanisms underlying the adaptive use of recognition.},

Even though other individual characteristics in decision making (e.g., risk attitude) seem to be domain-speciﬁc, it is commonly assumed that a person’s decision style is relatively stable across decision domains. Using a domain-speciﬁc extension of the Uniﬁed Scale to Assess Individual Differences in Intuition and Deliberation (USID), we found that preference for intuition and preference for deliberation showed considerable variability across domains (e.g., choosing a dress vs. choosing a doctor). In addition, domain-speciﬁc preferences for intuition were consistently correlated with self-rated expertise in making decisions in the respective domain. Our results indicate that a person’s domain-general decision style does not necessarily generalize across decision domains, and that the domain-speciﬁcity of preferences for intuition seems to be driven partly by differences in expertise.},

	abstract = {Factors that contribute to overcoming decision-making biases in later life pose an important investigational question given the increasing older adult population. Limited empirical evidence exists and the literature remains equivocal of whether increasing age is associated with elevated susceptibility to decision-making biases such as framing effects. Research into the individual differences contributing to decision-making ability may offer better understanding of the inﬂuence of age in decision-making ability. Changes in cognition underlying decision-making have been shown with increased age and may contribute to individual variability in decision-making abilities. This study had three aims; (1) to understand the inﬂuence of age on susceptibility to decision-making biases as measured by framing effects across a large, continuous age range; (2) to examine inﬂuence of cognitive abilities that change with age; and (3) to understand the inﬂuence of individual factors such as gender and education on susceptibility to framing effects. 200 individuals (28–79 years of age) were tested on a large battery of cognitive measures in the domains of executive function, memory and complex attention. Findings from this study demonstrated that cognitive abilities such as strategic control and delayed memory better predicted susceptibility to framing biases than age. The current ﬁndings demonstrate that age may not be as inﬂuential a factor in decisionmaking as cognitive ability and cognitive reserve. These ﬁndings motivate future studies to better characterize cognitive ability to determine decision-making susceptibilities in aging populations.},

	abstract = {According to the recognition-heuristic theory, decision makers solve paired comparisons in which one object is recognized and the other not by recognition alone, inferring that recognized objects have higher criterion values than unrecognized ones. However, success—and thus usefulness—of this heuristic depends on the validity of recognition as a cue, and adaptive decision making, in turn, requires that decision makers are sensitive to it. To this end, decision makers could base their evaluation of the recognition validity either on the selected set of objects (the set’s recognition validity), or on the underlying domain from which the objects were drawn (the domain’s recognition validity). In two experiments, we manipulated the recognition validity both in the selected set of objects and between domains from which the sets were drawn. The results clearly show that use of the recognition heuristic depends on the domain’s recognition validity, not on the set’s recognition validity. In other words, participants treat all sets as roughly representative of the underlying domain and adjust their decision strategy adaptively (only) with respect to the more general environment rather than the specific items they are faced with.},

Whereas model-free learning is evident across development, recruitment of model-based learning appears to increase with age. However, the cognitive processes underlying the development of model-based learning remain poorly characterized. Here, we examined whether age-related differences in cognitive processes underlying the construction and ﬂexible recruitment of mental models predict developmental increases in model-based choice. In a cohort of participants aged 9–25, we examined whether the abilities to infer sequential regularities in the environment (“statistical learning”), maintain information in an active state (“working memory”) and integrate distant concepts to solve problems (“ﬂuid reasoning”) predicted age-related improvements in model-based choice. We found that age-related improvements in statistical learning performance did not mediate the relationship between age and model-based choice. Ceiling performance on our working memory assay prevented examination of its contribution to model-based learning. However, age-related improvements in ﬂuid reasoning statistically mediated the developmental increase in the recruitment of a model-based strategy. These ﬁndings suggest that gradual development of ﬂuid reasoning may be a critical component process underlying the emergence of model-based learning.},

We were particularly interested in the competing roles of fluid cognitive ability and domain knowledge and experience, with the former being a negative influence and the latter being a positive influence on older adults’ performance. Participants utilized 2 decision matrices, which varied in complexity, regarding a consumer purchase. Using process tracing software and an algorithm developed to assess decision strategy, we recorded search behavior, strategy selection, and final decision. Contrary to expectations, older adults were not more likely than the younger age groups to engage in information-minimizing search behaviors in response to increases in task complexity. Similarly, adults of all ages used comparable decision strategies and adapted their strategies to the demands of the task. We also examined decision outcomes in relation to participants’ preferences. Overall, it seems that older adults utilize simpler sets of information primarily reflecting the most valued attributes in making their choice. The results of this study suggest that older adults are adaptive in their approach to decision making and that this ability may benefit from accrued knowledge and experience.},

In two experiments, we administered a version of the German cities task developed by Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996), in which participants had to decide which of two cities had the larger population. Decision makers were not provided with the names of the cities, but they were able to collect different kinds of cues for both response alternatives (e.g., “Does this city have a university?”) before making a decision. Our experiments differed in whether participants were free to determine the number of cues they examined. We demonstrate that a novel model, using hierarchical latent mixtures and Bayesian inference (Lee \& Newell, 2011) provides a more complete description of the data from both experiments than simple conventional strategies, such as the take–the–best or the Weighted Additive heuristics.},

	abstract = {The maintenance of a healthy skin barrier is crucial to prevent and treat atopic dermatitis (AD) lesions and avoid infections. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a bioactive peptide that has demonstrated promising results as an antiinﬂammatory and antipruritic therapy for experimental AD. This study aimed to analyze the effect of GMP on impaired cutaneous barrier-related signs in a rat model of AD lesions. AD-like dermatitis was induced on the skin by repeated topical applications of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, and animals were orally administered GMP before or after AD induction. The expression of skin structural proteins and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was evaluated by immunoblot or immunohistochemistry, epidermal thickening was evaluated by histochemistry, the level of IFN-c and changes in the microbiota were evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the quantity of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was evaluated by gas chromatography. GMP administration signiﬁcantly increased ﬁlaggrin, b-defensin 2, and cathelicidin-related AMP expression in AD-like lesions. Involucrin expression was not modiﬁed. In GMP-treated animals, epidermal thickening and IFN-c expression were strongly reduced in damaged skin. GMP treatment impacted the skin microbiota and prevented Staphylococcus aureus colonization, which is associated with AD. In addition, high levels of Biﬁdobacterium were detected in the feces of GMP-treated animals, and the acetic acid and butyric acid contents increased in animals prophylactically administered GMP. These results suggest that GMP markedly prevents or reverses skin barrier damage in rat AD-like lesions through a biﬁdogenic effect that induces fecal SCFA production with prolonged treatment. Our ﬁndings provide evidence that GMP may represent an optimum strategy for the therapy of the dysfunctional cutaneous barrier in AD.},

The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of GMP administration on DNCB-induced AD in rats. The severity of inflammatory process, pruritus, production of cytokines, and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) content were measured, and the histopathological features were analyzed. GMP reduced the intensity of inflammatory process and edema of DNCB-induced dermatitis, with a significant decrease in eosinophils recruitment and mast cells hyperplasia. In addition GMP suppressed the serum levels of total IgE and IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 expression in AD-lesions. Besides, the levels of IL-10 were significantly increased. Remarkably, GMP administration before AD-induction abolished pruritus in dermatitis-like reactions in the rats. Taken together, these results indicate that GMP has an inhibitory effect on AD by downregulating Th2 dominant immune response, suggesting GMP as a potential effective alternative therapy for the prevention and management of AD.},

Furthermore, once set, the architecture of the CCN network and the models of each individual unit should remain fixed throughout all applications. Because of the greater weight they place on biological accuracy, CCN models differ substantially from traditional neural network models in how each individual unit is modeled, how learning is modeled, and how behavior is generated from the network. A variety of CCN solutions to these three problems are described. A real example of this approach is described, and some advantages and limitations of the CCN approach are discussed.},

	abstract = {This article describes empirical and theoretical results from two multi-attribute sequential search tasks. In both tasks, the DM sequentially encounters options described by two attributes and must pay to learn the values of the attributes. In the continuous version of the task the DM learns the precise numerical value of an attribute when she pays to view it. In the threshold version the DM learns only whether the value of an attribute is above or below a threshold that she sets herself. Results from the continuous condition reveal that DMs tended to terminate their searches too early relative to the optimal policy. The pattern reversed in the threshold condition: DMs searched for too long. Maximum likelihood comparisons of two diﬀerent stochastic decision models showed that DMs under both information conditions performed in ways consistent with the optimal policies. Those oﬀered continuous-valued attribute information did not, however, spontaneously degrade this information into binary (acceptable/unacceptable) form, despite the theoretical ﬁnding that satisﬁcing can be a very eﬀective and eﬃcient search strategy.},

Using eye tracking and multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data, we measured participants’ dimensional attention as they performed a trial-and-error learning task in which only one of three stimulus dimensions was relevant for reward at any given time. Analysis of participants’ choices revealed that attention biased both value computation during choice and value update during learning. Value signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and prediction errors in the striatum were similarly biased by attention. In turn, participants’ focus of attention was dynamically modulated by ongoing learning. Attentional switches across dimensions correlated with activity in a frontoparietal attention network, which showed enhanced connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex between switches. Our results suggest a bidirectional interaction between attention and learning: attention constrains learning to relevant dimensions of the environment, while we learn what to attend to via trial and error.},

In the vendor selection problem, for example, the product price could be the major factor that should be optimized, while the product quality and delivery time could be the minor factors that should satisfy certain aspiration levels. We ﬁrst derive the optimal selection strategy for the discrete-time case in which one alternative is presented at each time period. The discretetime model is then extended to the continuous-time case in which alternatives are presented sequentially at random times.

	abstract = {The ﬁrst aim of this research is to compare computational models of multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice when attribute values are explicit. The choice predictions of utility (standard random utility \& weighted valuation), heuristic (elimination-by-aspects, lexicographic, \& maximum attribute value), and dynamic (multi-alternative decision ﬁeld theory, MDFT, \& a version of the multi-attribute linear ballistic accumulator, MLBA) models are contrasted on both preferential and risky choice data. Using both maximum likelihood and cross-validation ﬁt measures on choice data, the utility and dynamic models are preferred over the heuristic models for risky choice, with a slight overall advantage for the MLBA for preferential choice. The response time predictions of these models (except the MDFT) are then tested. Although the MLBA accurately predicts response time distributions, it only weakly accounts for stimulus-level differences. The other models completely fail to account for stimulus-level differences. Process tracing measures, i.e., eye and mouse tracking, were also collected. None of the qualitative predictions of the models are completely supported by that data. These results suggest that the models may not appropriately represent the interaction of attention and preference formation. To overcome this potential shortcoming, the second aim of this research is to test preference-formation assumptions, independently of attention, by developing the models of attentional sampling (MAS) model family which incorporates the empirical gaze patterns into a sequential sampling framework. An MAS variant that includes attribute values, but only updates the currently viewed alternative and does not contrast values across alternatives, performs well in both experiments. Overall, the results support the dynamic models, but point to the need to incorporate a framework that more accurately reﬂects the relationship between attention and the preference-formation process.},

	url = {http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/244269},
	abstract = {Diffusion decision models are immensely successful models for human and animal decisions under uncertainty. The decisions they model require the temporal accumulation of evidence to improve choice accuracy, and thus balance the trade-off between the decisions’ speed and their accuracy. Commonly, diffusion models have a one-dimensional abstract input that represents noisy momentary decision-related evidence. However, the nervous system typically uses population codes to represent sensory variables, which implies that the momentary evidence is distributed across multiple inputs. It is currently unknown how decision makers could learn how to combine these multiple inputs to obtain a one-dimensional abstract decision variable. We present here a Bayesian learning rule for learning a near-optimal linear combination of these inputs based on trial-by-trial feedback. The rule is Bayesian in the sense that it learns not only the mean of the weights but also the uncertainty around this mean in the form of a covariance matrix. This yields a rule whose learning rate is strongly modulated by decision confidence, providing a computational role of the latter for every-day decisions. Furthermore, we show that, in volatile environments, the rule predicts a bias towards repeating the same choice after correct decisions, with a bias strength that is modulated by the previous choice’ difficulty. Last, we extend our learning rule to cases for which one of the choices is more likely a-priori, which provides new insights into how such biases modulate the mechanisms leading to optimal decisions in diffusion models.},

But how does the brain learn to associate conﬁgurations with outcomes and how does this learning differ from learning about individual elements? We combined behavior, reinforcement learning models, and functional imaging to understand how people learn to associate conﬁgurations of cues with outcomes. We found that conﬁgural learning depended on the relative predictive strength of elements versus conﬁgurations and was related to both the strength of BOLD activity and patterns of BOLD activity in the hippocampus. Conﬁgural learning was further related to functional connectivity between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Moreover, conﬁgural learning was associated with ﬂexible knowledge about associations and differential eye movements during choice. Together, this suggests that conﬁgural learning is associated with a distinct computational, cognitive, and neural proﬁle that is well suited to support ﬂexible and adaptive behavior.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on the division of labor between evolution and development in solving sequential, statedependent decision problems. Currently, behavioral ecologists tend to use dynamic programming methods to study such problems. These methods are successful at predicting animal behavior in a variety of contexts. However, they depend on a distinct set of assumptions. Here, we argue that behavioral ecology will beneﬁt from drawing more than it currently does on a complementary collection of tools, called reinforcement learning methods. These methods allow for the study of behavior in highly complex environments, which conventional dynamic programming methods do not feasibly address. In addition, reinforcement learning methods are wellsuited to studying how biological mechanisms solve developmental and learning problems. For instance, we can use them to study simple rules that perform well in complex environments. Or to investigate under what conditions natural selection favors ﬁxed, non-plastic traits (which do not vary across individuals), cue-driven-switch plasticity (innate instructions for adaptive behavioral development based on experience), or developmental selection (the incremental acquisition of adaptive behavior based on experience). If natural selection favors developmental selection, which includes learning from environmental feedback, we can also make predictions about the design of reward systems. Our paper is written in an accessible manner and for a broad audience, though we believe some novel insights can be drawn from our discussion. We hope our paper will help advance the emerging bridge connecting the ﬁelds of behavioral ecology and reinforcement learning.},

The model encodes a continuous analog stimulus feature and is thus applicable to multiple-choice decisions. Importantly, the continuous network captures similarity between alternatives and possible overlaps in their neural representation. Model simulations accounted for behavioral as well as single-unit neurophysiological data from a recent monkey experiment and revealed testable predictions about the patterns of error rate as a function of the similarity between the correct and actual choices. We also found that the similarity and number of options affect speed and accuracy of responses. A mechanism is proposed for ﬂexible control of speed-accuracy tradeoff, based on a simple top-down signal to the decision circuit that may vary nonmonotonically with the number of choice alternatives.},

The traditional method has been Random Utility Maximisation (RUM) and recent interest has focussed on Random Regret Minimisation (RRM), but there are many other possibilities. Decision Field Theory (DFT), a dynamic model popular in mathematical psychology, has recently been put forward as a rival to RUM but has not yet been investigated in detail or compared against other competing models like RRM. This paper considers arguments in favour of using DFT, reviews how it has been used in transport literature so far and provides theoretical improvements to further the mechanisms behind DFT to better represent general decision making. In particular, we demonstrate how the probability of alternatives can be calculated after any number of timesteps in a DFT model. We then look at how to best operationalise DFT using simulated datasets, ﬁnding that it can cope with underlying preferences towards alternatives, can include socio-demographic variables and that it performs best when standard score normalisation is applied to the alternative attribute levels. We also present a detailed comparison of DFT and Multinomial Logit (MNL) models using stated preference route choice datasets and ﬁnd that DFT achieves signiﬁcantly better ﬁt in estimation as well as forecasting. We also ﬁnd that our theoretical improvement provides DFT with much greater ﬂexibility and that there are numerous approaches that can be adopted to incorporate heterogeneity within a DFT model. In particular, random parameters vastly improve the model ﬁt.},

To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

	abstract = {Consumers’ choices are typically influenced by the choice context in ways that standard models cannot explain. We provide a concise explanation of the attraction, compromise and similarity effects. The model, Multi-Attribute Decision by Sampling (MADS), posits that the evaluation of a choice option is based on its relative position in the market distribution as first inferred and then sampled by the decision-maker. The inferred market distribution is assumed to be systematically influenced by the choice options. The value of a choice option is assumed to be determined by the number of sampled comparators that the option dominates. We specify conditions on the sampling distribution that are sufficient for MADS to predict the three context effects. We tested the model using a novel experimental design with 1200 online participants. In the first experiment, prior to making a choice participants were shown a selection of market options designed to change their beliefs about the market distribution. Participants’ subsequent choices were affected as predicted. The effect was strong enough to impact the size of two of the three classic context effects significantly. In the second experiment, we elicited individuals’ estimates of distributions of market options and found the estimates to be systematically influenced by the choice set as predicted by the model. It is concluded that MADS, a model based on simple binary ordinal comparisons, is sufficient to account for the three classic context effects.},

To further challenge the model, we trained and tested European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in an environment with a background of four alternatives differing in delay to reinforcement. Unexpected binary choices between the six possible pairs of alternatives were used to assess preference. The model’s predictions of the strength of preference roughly corresponded to the bird’s choices for each of the six choice situations. More importantly, a trial-by-trial test of the model correctly predicted 84\% of all individual choice trials. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Their model extends Gabaix et al.’s (2006) directed cognition model by capturing fatigue, proximity effects, and imperfect memory encoding and by estimating individual-level parameters and partworths within a likelihood-based hierarchical Bayesian framework. The authors show that modeling eye movements as the outcome of forward-looking utility maximization improves out-of-sample predictions, enables researchers and practitioners to use shorter questionnaires, and allows better discrimination between attributes.},
