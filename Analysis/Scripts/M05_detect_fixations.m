%% FIXATION DETECTION USING THE IDENTIFICATION BY 2-MEANS CLUSTERING (I2MC) ALGORITHM
% Description:
% The I2MC algorithm was designed to accomplish fixation detection in data
% across a wide range of noise levels and when periods of data loss may
% occur.

%% NECESSARY VARIABLES

opt.freq     = 250; % sampling frequency of data (check that this value matches with values actually obtained from measurement!)

% Variables for the calculation of visual angle
% These values are used to calculate noise measures (RMS and BCEA) of
% fixations. The may be left as is, but don't use the noise measures then.
% If either or both are empty, the noise measures are provided in pixels
% instead of degrees.

% Plot results
do.plots = 0; % if set to 1, plot of fixation detection for each trial will be saved as png-file in output folder.
% the figures works best for short trials (up to around 20 seconds)

%% OPTIONAL VARIABLES
% The settings below may be used to adopt the default settings of the
% algorithm. Do this only if you know what you're doing. Uncomment the
% settings below and run the algorithm.

% 
% % K-MEANS CLUSTERING
% opt.windowtime   = 0.2;  % time window (s) over which to calculate 2-means clustering (choose value so that max. 1 saccade can occur)
% opt.steptime     = 0.02; % time window shift (s) for each iteration. Use zero for sample by sample processing
% opt.maxerrors    = 100;  % maximum number of errors allowed in k-means clustering procedure before proceeding to next file
% opt.downsamples  = [2 5 10];
opt.downsampFilter = 0; % use chebychev filter when downsampling? 1: yes, 0: no. requires signal processing toolbox. is what matlab's downsampling functions do, but could cause trouble (ringing) with the hard edges in eye-movement data
% 
% % FIXATION DETERMINATION
% opt.cutoffstd   = 2; % number of standard deviations above mean k-means weights will be used as fixation cutoff
